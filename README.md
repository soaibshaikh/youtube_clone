# Getting Started with Create React YouTube Clone App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### YouTube Clone App (Website Url : https://ss-youtube-clone.netlify.app)

The YouTube clone app is developed using React.js is a web application that replicates some of the core features and functionalities of the popular video-sharing platform, YouTube. The app provides users with the ability to browse and watch videos, search for specific content, and interact with the available video content.

Key Features:
1. **Video Playback**: Users can watch videos directly within the app's interface. The app utilizes React components to render the video player, allowing seamless playback of video content.

2. **Video Search**: The app includes a search functionality that enables users to search for videos based on specific keywords or queries. The search feature utilizes APIs to fetch and display relevant videos based on user input.

3. **Video Recommendations**: Users can view a list of recommended videos based on their viewing history or other criteria. The app employs algorithms or API integrations to generate personalized video recommendations.

4. **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and accessible across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It leverages CSS media queries and responsive design principles to ensure optimal user experience on various screen sizes.

7. **Video Metadata**: The app displays relevant video metadata, such as title, view count, like count, and channel information. This information is retrieved from APIs and presented alongside the video player.

Overall, your YouTube clone app built with React.js offers users a kind of similar experience to the original YouTube platform, providing the ability to browse, search, and interact with video content. It demonstrates my skills in front-end development, React component architecture, API integration, and responsive design.
